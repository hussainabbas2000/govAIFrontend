## Original User Request:
*Vision Statement*
To develop a comprehensive online application that enables users to discover and pursue government contract opportunities (e.g., SAM.gov, SEPTA) based on their business offerings and preferences. The platform will leverage AI to automate the full bid lifecycle — from opportunity identification to bid submission and delivery monitoring — improving efficiency, accuracy, and competitiveness.

*Enhanced Requirements (Summarized):*
*Opportunity Discovery:*

AI scans portals like SAM.gov and SEPTA to identify relevant contract opportunities based on user profiles, industries, and product categories.

Users can set filters and preferences for opportunity alerts (e.g., NAICS codes, location, contract size).

*Product and Pricing Intelligence:*

AI identifies required products/services listed in the bid.

System suggests optimal products from the user's catalog or vendor ecosystem.

AI fetches pricing trends, historical data, and recommended price points.

The system submits the bid electronically and logs confirmation.

*Lifecycle Tracking:*

Dashboards track the full lifecycle: opportunity identification → vendor quote → admin approval → bid submission → post-submission status.

Alerts and notifications are provided at each phase (e.g., bid deadline reminders, submission confirmations, award notices).

*User Roles & Permissions:*

Role-based access for Admins, Sales Reps, Vendor Managers, and AI Operations Monitor.

Timeline: 2 weeks effort (Need an Cloud based Ai Application working model) with the MVP for SAM.gov and Septa to start with by May 5th. Later we can repolish and onboard other portals.

One key Design concept to keep in minde while designing. That the system should be pushing information to the user, rather than the need for user to pull information. The dashboard should be simplified with the ability to view Total number of bids, trends of sale, etc etc. Thanks
